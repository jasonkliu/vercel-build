# vercel-build

- If a change is made only to `backend/`, do not build.
- Otherwise, build (including `src/` and root directory)
- `git diff` doesn't return correct error codes, so need to be creative

## How to use

1. Add `vercel.sh` to the root of your repo. Modify the script as necessary.
2. Vercel > Settings > Git > Ignored Build Step. Set it up to `bash vercel.sh`
